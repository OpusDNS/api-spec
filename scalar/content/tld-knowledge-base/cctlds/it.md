# 🇮🇹 .it — Italy

> The **.it** is a country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) operated by Istituto di Informatica e Telematica (IIT-CNR). This article documents the technical, operational, and contractual requirements for the TLD, along with special considerations for registry, registrar, and domain management.

## Contact Attributes

`.it` carries two registry-specific attributes on the **registrant** contact, beyond the standard EPP fields. Both are required on registrations and inbound transfers:

| Attribute | Type | Required | Applies to | Allowed values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NIC_IT_ENTITY_TYPE` | Enum | ✅ Required | Registrant | See the entity-type table below |
| `NIC_IT_REG_CODE` | String | ✅ Required | Registrant | Tax or registration code, 1-36 chars (format depends on the entity type) |

### Entity types (`NIC_IT_ENTITY_TYPE`)

The registrant declares its legal nature through `NIC_IT_ENTITY_TYPE`. That value drives the nationality, organization, and registration-code rules below. The registry code is the number NIC.it echoes back in policy errors (e.g. "entity type = 1").

| Value | Legal nature | Registry code | Natural person |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `natural_person` | Natural person | 1 | ✅ |
| `company` | Company / one-person company | 2 | ❌ |
| `individual_firm` | Freelancer / sole proprietor | 3 | ❌ |
| `non_profit` | Non-profit organization | 4 | ❌ |
| `public_org` | Public organization | 5 | ❌ |
| `other` | Other entity | 6 | ❌ |
| `foreign_legal_entity` | Foreign (non-Italian) legal entity | 7 | ❌ |

### Registration code (`NIC_IT_REG_CODE`)

The expected format depends on the entity type and nationality:

| Entity type | Expected code |
| --- | --- |
| `natural_person` (Italian) | 16-character Codice Fiscale |
| `natural_person` (non-Italian) | Home-country identifier (no format check) |
| `company`, `public_org`, `other` | 11-digit Partita IVA |
| `individual_firm` | Codice Fiscale or Partita IVA |
| `non_profit` | Partita IVA, or the literal `N.A.` when none exists |
| `foreign_legal_entity` | Home-country identifier (no format check) |

### Nationality, province, and organization

The registrant's standard fields are constrained by the entity type:

- **Country** (`contact.country`):
   - Italian legal types (`company`, `individual_firm`, `non_profit`, `public_org`, `other`) must be `IT`
   - `foreign_legal_entity` must be a non-`IT` country in the EEA plus Vatican, San Marino, Switzerland, and the UK
   - `natural_person` may be any country in that same EEA-plus set, including `IT`
- **Province** (`contact.state`): required and must be a valid 2-letter Italian province code (e.g. `RM`, `MI`, `NA`) whenever the country is `IT`
- **Organization** (`contact.org`):
   - required for every legal-entity type
   - for `natural_person` it must be omitted or equal the contact's full name

### Per-role rules

`.it` is a thick registry with a registrant, admin, and tech contact. A few cross-role rules are enforced before the request reaches the registry:

- the **tech** contact is required, on both create and update
- for a `natural_person` registrant, the **admin** contact must reference the same contact as the registrant
- the registrant is immutable through a normal update: omit it and the existing registrant is kept; it cannot be replaced via `update`

> ⚠️ **Reusing one contact for every role?** For a `natural_person` registrant the admin has to be that same contact, and any contacts update must still carry a tech. The two failures integrators hit most:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "type": "policy-validation-error",
>   "title": "Policy Validation Error",
>   "status": 422,
>   "code": "ERROR_POLICY_VALIDATION",
>   "errors": [
>     {
>       "detail": "For 'natural_person' registrant, the admin contact must reference the same contact as the registrant",
>       "pointer": "contacts.admin[0].contact_id"
>     }
>   ],
>   "detail": "Policy validation failed"
> }
> ```
>
> ```json
> {
>   "type": "policy-validation-error",
>   "title": "Policy Validation Error",
>   "status": 422,
>   "code": "ERROR_POLICY_VALIDATION",
>   "errors": [
>     {
>       "detail": "Tech contact is required",
>       "pointer": "contacts.tech"
>     }
>   ],
>   "detail": "Policy validation failed"
> }
> ```

The attribute constraints are machine-readable: each `possible_attributes` entry returned by [`GET /v1/tlds/it`](/api-reference#tag/tld/GET/v1/tlds/{tld}) carries its own `values`, `required`, and `contact_roles` fields.

## Registrant Policy Acknowledgement

`.it` registrations and inbound transfers require the registrar to confirm — on the registrant's behalf — compliance with the Registro .it (IIT-CNR) policies, and to pass those policies on to the domain owner. Surface the acknowledgement below to the end user **before** submitting a `.it` create or transfer; the confirmation is mandatory for both operations.

### Confirmation text

Present a single **required** checkbox. The registrant must accept it for the create or transfer to proceed. Suggested copy in English and German:

**English**

> Please confirm that you comply with the following policies and that you will pass them on to the domain owner accordingly.

> ℹ️ The acknowledgement is required for **both** `.it` registrations and inbound transfers. Capture the confirmation at the point of sale for each operation — a prior registration does not carry the acknowledgement over to a later transfer.
