/**
 * Auto-generated API path constants
 *
 * This file is generated from the OpenAPI specification. Each constant maps to a
 * path string defined in the spec, enabling reuse across the codebase.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Constants follow the pattern API_<PATH>
 * - Path parameters are normalized to uppercase snake case (e.g. {domain_id} -> DOMAIN_ID)
 * - The root path '/' is represented by API_ROOT
 *
 * Do not edit manually.
